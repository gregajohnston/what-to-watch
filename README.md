# What_to_watch

This program reads through a database of information from MovieLens. The database has a list of movies, along with a set of users who rated movies they saw.

The program is reached through a command line prompt, which provides the relevant user actions. A user may type 0, or any user id number, to see a list of best-rated movies. If they choose a user number, it omits any movie the user had rated.

The user may also type 'quit' to exit the program.
